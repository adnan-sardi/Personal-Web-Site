									<h2><a>How Helping Others Helps You</a></h2>
									<p></p>
								</header>
									<p></span>
									For 4 years I have been a volunteer at Red Cross in Novara learned a lot 
									about helping people, and managing difficult situations among other things. 
									Here I want to pick up those steps that helped me, without my knowledge, to 
									become a solid contributor to society.
									</br></br>
									<h3>Enhanced Empathy</h3>
									Volunteering allows us to step into the shoes of others, fostering empathy and compassion. 
									By understanding the challenges faced by those in need, we develop a greater appreciation for 
									our own blessings and become more sensitive to the struggles of others.
									</br></br>
									<h3>Personal Fulfillment</h3>
									The act of helping others provides a profound sense of fulfillment and purpose. Witnessing the 
									positive impact we make in someone's life leaves an indelible mark on our own sense of well-being 
									and satisfaction.
									</br></br>
									<h3>Expanded Perspective</h3>
									Volunteering exposes us to diverse communities and cultures, broadening our horizons and challenging 
									our preconceived notions. It helps us appreciate the rich tapestry of humanity and fosters a greater 
									understanding of global issues.
									</br></br>
									<h2>Leadership Development through Volunteerism</h2>
									During my journey as a volunteer, I was able to improve my leadership and people management skills 
									with a course on "Team leader in maxi-emergency activities," here I would like to list some aspects I 
									learned:
									<ul class="alt">
										<li>Communication: Volunteer work involves interacting with diverse individuals and teams, honing your ability to effectively communicate, listen, and collaborate.</li>
										<li>Adaptability: Working in dynamic environments and encountering various challenges helps you develop flexibility, adaptability, and the capacity to navigate through uncertainty.</li>
										<li>Problem-Solving: As a volunteer, you'll encounter situations that require quick thinking and creative problem-solving. This experience sharpens your critical thinking skills and resourcefulness.</li>
											<a class="image right"><img src="blog images/me in cri cut.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<li>Teamwork: Collaboration is at the core of volunteer work. You will learn to work with people from diverse backgrounds, leveraging their strengths and fostering a supportive team environment.</li>
										<li>Time Management: Balancing volunteer commitments alongside personal and professional obligations improves your time management skills and ability to prioritize tasks effectively.</li>
										<li>Empathy and Emotional Intelligence: Volunteering helps cultivate empathy and emotional intelligence as you interact with individuals facing challenging circumstances, allowing you to develop.</li>
									</ul>
